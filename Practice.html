    <H1> TECHNIQUE OF JAZZ DANCE CONTEMPORERY</H1>
           
 <p align= "justify">For most of you, it’s that time of year when you are working hard to clean up and improve those routines! However, while you spend the majority of time at practice focusing on your routines, you shouldn’t forget to continue improving upon the most critical element in dance ... TECHNIQUE! Technique is the basis of all fundamentals of dance, from holding your body correctly while performing, to executing skills properly in a routine. Strong technique extends across all areas of dance, regardless of the style of your routine. Whether it’s jazz, pom, hip hop, or kick, there is always an element of technique that can be improved upon. So give your girls a much needed break from routine cleaning at practice, and work on their technique for at least a half hour each time you meet! Below, you will find some helpful tips to use with your teams at practice to improve their overall technique as dancers.</p>

<h3>Body Alignment</h3>
                
<p align="justify">Sometimes dancers get caught up in the choreography and forget to hold themselves correctly when dancing. Whether your dancers are beginners or more advanced, it never hurts to go back over the basics of body alignment. Have them stand with their feet together, hands by their sides, and go from the top down of how they should be holding their bodies:</p>
                
<h1><div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3placeholder"> <img src="http://www.southjerseyballet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Escape.jpg" width="400" height="400" class="img-responsive" alt="square center"></h1>
    
<p>•Lifted chin, elongated neck, eyes off the floor.</p>
<p>•Shoulders pressed naturally down and back</p>
<p>•Rib cage closed, as if there was a safety pin holding it together.</p>
<p>•Stomach muscles engaged.</p>
<p>•Hips held even and level.</p>
<p>•Knees relaxed, not locked.</p>
<p>•Feet parallel or turned out (remind them that their turnout comes from their hips, with their knees in a line over their toes).</p>

    <h3><p>Pom and Kick</p></h3>
    
<p align="left">•All motions should be held in front of the dancer, to where they can see their hands using their peripheral vision.</p>
<p align="left">•Watch for broken wrists (a line should be drawn from the shoulder to the middle finger of the fist).</p>
<p align="justify">•Drill your dancers on motions as you call them and they execute. The burn sensation a dancer feels when they have worked the muscle to the max is a sign that the exercises are working. Stop if you feel any pain.</p>
<p align="left">•Distinguish between breaking your arms from one motion to the next or keeping them straight.</p>
<p align="left">•With kicks, backs should be straight, chins lifted, toes pointed, and hips level.</p>


<h3>Turns</h3>
    
<p align="justify">•Begin with their prep, making sure they have an even weight distribution between both legs.</p>
<p align="justify">•Have them practice moving from the prep to the turn position without the actual rotation to practice finding their center of balance (remind your dancers that if they will execute proper body alignment they will find their center for turns).</p>
    
<p align="justify">•Practice spotting by going across the floor doing chaine turns, which are turns that link together by simply staying on the balls of the feet and spotting as you take tiny steps (they should be focusing on one spot and whipping their head directly back to it after each rotation).</p>
    
<p align="justify">•Work on control by having them walk across the floor starting on the right foot 1-2-3, prep on 4, balance or turn 5-6, down to their right knee 7-8 (this will teach them to have control and to remain lifted coming out of their turns).</p>

<p align="justify">•Execute turns on the floor, whether singles, doubles, triples, etc. watching for shoulders that go up, arms that wind up before the turn, dancers who do not remain on the ball of their foot for the duration of the turn, and hips that are uneven.</p>

<h3>Leaps and Jumps</h3>
    
<p>•Constantly remind your dancers to point and stretch their feet the second they leave the ground.</p>
<p>•Encourage your dancers to use their plie instead of their arms to gain height on any jump/leap. Plie, push off both feet to go up and your dancers will “fly.” Make sure to land in plie out of any aerial movement to avoid injuries.</p>
<p>•With toe touches or leaps in second, make sure their hips are level and their bottoms are tucked under.</p>
<p>•Always have them land in plie in elevation skills, with knees bent, to avoid injury.</p>
<p>•Watch their eyes, have them try lifting their chins, to gain even more height.</p>
    
<p align="justify">Once your students master the basics, your dancers are ready to challenge themselves with more advanced skills and technical elements. Dance is like building blocks, after one skill is mastered, your dancers will be ready for the next. Practice and repetition are the keys to success. If you are worried about incorporating difficulty, remember that difficulty in a routine is
not necessarily measured by the level of the skill performed, but rather the proper execution of it.</p>
