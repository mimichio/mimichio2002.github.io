            <h1>JAZZ DANCE</h1>
<p align="justify">Jazz dance is often credited as an American creation, however in actuality it originates from African American vernacular dance that came about during the late 1800s. The first official American "jazz dancer" was Joe Frisco around the year 1910, who performed in vaudeville, however its roots trace much further back than this, with many moves being created by the slaves as a much needed physical and emotional outlet. Slave traders often allowed them to dance during their journey over to America, as an attempt to keep them physically fit. Not only did it work, but it formed an impressive series of dance techniques and steps that made history.</p>

<p align="justify">The original steps were exemplified out in the plantations, and jazz dance itself came about as a crossbreed of American culture, European jigs and the music and movement tradition of the African slaves. Jazz music obviously inspired some of the first documented jazz dance choreography, and this further adds to the rich and diverse history of jazz dance. Europe lent elegance to the technique, Africa gave it its movement and rhythm, and America allowed it to have the exposure and growing popularity that has sustained it as a cherished dance style today.</p>
    
<h2> CONTEMPORERY DANCE</h2>
    
<p align="justify">Contemporary dance is a dance performance genre that developed during the mid twentieth  
century and has since grown to become one of the dominant genres for formally trained
dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
    
<p align="justify">Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical, modern, and jazz styles, it 
has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance. Due to its technical 
similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet and other 
classical concert dance styles.</p>

<p align="justify">In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong and controlled legwork of ballet with modern dance's stress on the torso, and also employs contract-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristic of modern dance.[2] Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. It sometimes also incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance Butoh.</p>
